## Installation

## Building and Deploying to Dataverse

To create and import a solution file:

```powershell
mkdir Solutions
cd Solutions
pac solution init --publisher-name developer --publisher-prefix dev
pac solution add-reference --path c:\downloads\mysamplecomponent
msbuild /t:restore
msbuild
# Or if you have installed the .NET SDK, version >= 6:
dotnet build
```

> Tip: If `msbuild 15.9.*` is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 to run the `msbuild` commands.

The generated solution files are located inside the `\bin\debug\` folder after the build is successful.

Manually import the solution into Dataverse using the web portal or automatically using the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools.

### Connecting to your environment

```powershell
pac auth create --url <https://xyz.crm.dynamics.com>
pac auth list
pac auth select --index <index of the active profile>
```

### Selecting the target environment

```powershell
pac env list
pac env select --index <index of the target environment>
```

### Deploying code components

Ensure that you have a valid authentication profile created. Navigate to the directory where the sample component file is located and push the code components to the Dataverse instance:

```powershell
pac pcf push --publisher-prefix <your publisher prefix> --publisher-name <your publisher name>
```

> Note: The publisher prefix that you use with the push command should match the publisher prefix of your solution in which the components will be included.
